Integers are either signed (positive, zero, or negative) or unsigned (positive or zero). Swift provides signed and unsigned integers in 8, 16, 32, and 64 bit forms. These integers follow a naming convention similar to C, in that an 8-bit unsigned integer is of type UInt8, and a 32-bit signed integer is of type Int32. Like all types in Swift, these integer types have capitalized names. In most cases, you don't need to pick a specific size of integer to use in your code. Swift provides an additional integer type, Int, which has the same size as the current platform's native word size:</p><ul class=\"simple\"><li>On a 32-bit platform, <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Int</span></code> is the same size as <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Int32</span></code>.</li><li>On a 64-bit platform, <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Int</span></code> is the same size as <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Int64</span></code>.</li></ul><p>Unless you need to work with a specific size of integer, always use Int for integer values in your code. This aids code consistency and interoperability. Even on 32-bit platforms, Int can store any value between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647, and is large enough for many integer ranges.</p><p>Floating-point numbers are numbers with a fractional component, such as 3.14159, 0.1, and -273.15. Floating-point types can represent a much wider range of values than integer types, and can store numbers that are much larger or smaller than can be stored in an Int. Swift provides two signed floating-point number types:</p><ul class=\"simple\"><li><code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Double</span></code> represents a 64-bit floating-point number.</li><li><code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Float</span></code> represents a 32-bit floating-point number.</li></ul>"

An optional represents two possibilities: Either there is a value, and you can unwrap the optional to access that value, or there isn't a value at all.</p><p>Here's an example of how optionals can be used to cope with the absence of a value. Swift's Int type has an initializer which tries to convert a String value into an Int value. However, not every string can be converted into an integer. The string \"123\" can be converted into the numeric value 123, but the string 'hello, world' doesn't have an obvious numeric value to convert to.</p><p>The example below uses the initializer to try to convert a String into an Int:</p><div class='highlight-swift notranslate'><div class='code-sample'><div class='Swift highlight'><ol class='code-lines'><li><span class='k'>let</span> <span class='nv'>possibleNumber</span> = <span class='s'>\"123\"</span></li><li><span class='k'>let</span> <span class='nv'>convertedNumber</span> = <span class='nv'>Int</span>(<span class='nv'>possibleNumber</span>) </li><li><span class='c'>// convertedNumber is inferred to be of type 'Int?', or 'optional Int'</span> </li></ol></div></div></div><p>Because the initializer might fail, it returns an optional Int, rather than an Int. An optional Int is written as Int?, not Int. The question mark indicates that the value it contains is optional, meaning that it might contain some Int value, or it might contain no value at all. (It can't contain anything else, such as a Bool value or a String value. It's either an Int, or it's nothing at all.)</p><p>You can use an if statement to find out whether an optional contains a value by comparing the optional against nil.
